1.Plan was to have a login page as welcoming page then after
clicking submit that where the user enters the details
of a customer so im struggling to link ejs files.
2.After entering the details of the customer and uploading I
wanted a graph to show details but instead i used a table just 
to shhw i can upload and get the data back.
